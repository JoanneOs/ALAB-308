//from the lesson: Any value that is not a variable is a literal. They are fixed values that you literally provide to your script.

const frost =
    `Nature’s first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf’s a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.`;

//now 3 using arithmetic operators to manipulate data.
let newNumber = 9;
newNumber -= 3; // newNumber is now equal to 6
newNumber /= 3; // newNumber is now equal to 2
newNumber *= 3; // newNumber is now equal to 6
newNumber %= 3; // newNumber is now equal to 0
console.log(newNumber); // this will type the last value in newNumber

//4-Use comparison operators to compare data.
// this example for my kids
let apples = 5;
let oranges = 3;
//is the number of apples same as orages?
let isAppleorOrange = apples == oranges;
//is the number of apples greater than oranges?
let isMorethan = apple > oranges;
//are oranges less or equal to apples?
let isLessorSame = oranges <= apples;
console.log(isAppleorOrange);

//still 4 comparing strings
let friend1="River";
let friend2="Selena";
//are both same?
let areFreindsSame=friend1==friend2;
